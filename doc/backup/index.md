# Backup

**1 - Backup of Lists**

Streamshare allows you to easily export and import your link lists in JSON format. To learn more, go to the ["Lists"](../list/index.md) section.

**2 - Full Backup**

If you wish to back up all your data, including all metadata for your streaming links, your devices, and your lists, you can directly copy the application's database. To do this, you will need to use your device's file explorer and access the data folder:

The databases are located in the `/data/data/com.tootiapps.streamshare/databases` folder.

Simply copy the entire contents of this folder to back up your data and restore it whenever you like. You can also copy this data directly to another device.

**Caution**

The "streamshare-baseSQL.db" database contains all sensitive information, including the list of your devices and access keys to your Alldebrid account. Please be cautious and do not share your database with third parties.
