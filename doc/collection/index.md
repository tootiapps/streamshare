# Collection

To access your collection, select the "Collection" tab.

Your collection is a view that allows you to browse your streaming lists based on the data we have extracted using the information.

Option accessible from the menu:

**1 - Scan Your Video Library**

When you have just imported a list into your application, it is not yet integrated into your collection. You can, of course, play your files from a list, but for an optimal experience, we recommend running a scan of your video library. This way, we will extract the metadata found in your streaming lists and integrate them into your video library.

**2 - Exclusion Management**

Some files, links, or sources are not intended to be included in your video library. You can select and exclude them using the exclusion management tool.

**3 - Clean Your Video Library**

Over time, you may have deleted lists or links from your lists. You can remove data that is no longer needed with this tool.
