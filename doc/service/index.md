# Service

**This feature is considered experimental.**

Services allow you to integrate compatible external services into your Streamshare application. They enable you to query a remote service and receive a list of links in response.

Services can handle Basic authentication or Token-based authentication.

To develop your own service, please refer to the dedicated documentation: [Streamshare Service Documentation](https://github.com/tootiapps/streamshare-service).
